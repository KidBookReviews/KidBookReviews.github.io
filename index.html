I am back here and today I will be writing a review on "Crickets Countryside" George Selden. This is a AMAZING follow up to "The Cricket in Times Square" and a great book in general! One of the BEST books I have ever seen plopped up before my eyes! Before you read the review on this book I would recommend you either read the first book, or look at its review. This book is about a cricket (from the previous book) who's meadow is being destroyed by tractors. While Tucker the mouse and Harry cat get plucked from the city life to the country life, to help the cricket save his meadow. Will Tucker be able to do anything about it? Or will the meadow go up in smithereens? Read the book to find out! I have to say this is a great book, which is probably even better than the first one! Which is why I give this book.. 5 STARS!</p>

Currently I will be reviewing a book SERIES that many people know. Somehow, I forgot to review this series called "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" by Jeff Kenny. Wow, I love these books SO MUCH. I didn't even need to look at the book to know who it's by! I memorized it by heart. I have read every single book in this series at LEAST 10 times. But there are 14 OF THEM! If you have not read these books you should most definitely check them out. The series is basically about a kid writing a journal of crazy times he has with his 2 brothers, mom, dad and best friend Rowley! "First of all, let me get something straight: This is a JOURNAL, not a diary." This series is super addicting and good, which is why I DEFFINETILY give it 5 STARS!</p>

Another book review yet again, this one is for "Castle Diary". Pretty decent book about a kid who is sent to be a page in his uncle's castle. And while he is there he keeps a detailed journal. I read this book and it taught me interesting stuff about the way people lived in 1285, but the story kind of made me doze but it is still interesting so I give it 4.3 STARS!</p>

Today I am going to review a book called "The Sword in the Tree" by Clyde Robert Bulla. This is a interesting book where a young boy's uncle comes into his father's castle and finds a way to kick him out, so the boy got a knight to help and regained the castle. I know its kind of ridiculous I do this on all my books but 5 STARS!</p>

Ok everybody I'm back, and today I am gonna be reviewing a very nice book called "Kid Spy" by Mac Barnett. I only have one complaint for this book, is it really true? Because at the start of the book it says "A note from the author: My name is Mac Barnet. I am an author. But before I was an author, I was a kid. And when I was a kid, I was a spy. An author's job is to make up stories. But the story you are about to read is true. This actually happened to me." That's so confusing dont you agree, because did the queen of England hire a boy to go do a spy job with a dog. Just because he has strait A's (other than in handwriting)? I dont think so because the end is ridiculous. Anyway I give this book a strait 5 STARS! congratulations to this book!!</p>

Today I would like to review "Gooney Bird on the Map" by Lois Lowry, illustrated by Middy Thomas. I Think this book is great for more of a read with your mom book, or a school book, I dont know if it would be good for nighttime reading. Anyway the book is about a Girl named Gooney Bird Greene and she is always thinking up good ideas for her class for school. This is a Great book and my recommendations are high. I dont want to tell you much about it so you can read it yourself. I give this book 5 STARS (this is a series book and the first book is called "Gooney Bird Greene" I am not sure what the order is but I would read the first book then any other book after)|||I forgot to rate this a long time ago so I will rate it now 4.8 STARS|||</p>

Hi. Today I would like to talk about "Utterly yours, Booker Jones" by Betsy Duffey. This is DEFINITELY one of my favorite books. It is so good. DONT WORRY, NO SPOILS.

Today I would like to talk about "Freaky Friday" by Mary Rodgers. THIS BOOK IS CRAZY. This is what it is about. It's about a girl and her Mom and then THEY SWITCH PLACES, And the girl does the chores of the Mom and the Mom does some crazy stuff. It's kind of hard to understand near the end, but I like it. 4.1 STARS The movie's a bit better.</p>

Today I would like to talk about "The 13 Story Treehouse" by Andy Griffiths. I only read the first book which is pretty short, but I already like it. Its short, fun, and very fictional, but reading it is very fun. NO SPOILERS. This story is about 2 kids who have a BIG treehouse and write books. Then their boss says to make a good book in a day or they will work at a monkey house. So the story is about them writing the book. I like the book but it kind of has some bad parts like its in the middle of a action scene it says suddenly "Chapter 12" and you cant stop. So I give this book 4.5 STARS</p>

Today I would like to talk about "I Funny" by James Patterson. I love "I Funny" it's great, I can't stop reading. If you want me to tell you what it is about, I won't spoil. It's about a kid in a wheelchair with a wild imagination, the kid is the comedian of the town and tells jokes. A lot of other cool things happen in the book but I don't want to spoil, so read it yourself. It is "I Funny" by James Patterson. 5 STARS. This book has a little bad language so use your own judgement.</p>
