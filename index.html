<h2>Basic info</h2>
<p>My pet is a beta fish named clent. he has a 2 gallon tank. His tank has a filter and little floating lof with a hole in its top so you can feed it. He also has a little hole in the roof of his tank for more oxagen to evapurate into the water. Clent is a Blue fish with a red little tail. He eats three little pebbles a day. His tank is also decorated with rocks at the bottom, big green smooth stones and a moss ball that picks up all the gross waste and dirt in his tank. In most of the day he hides inbetween his filter and the wall, or in his log. I have a guess that the reason he likes his filter so much is because it vibrates.

<h2>Why we dont have any other pets</h2>
<p>We only have one little fish named clent. I wish we had more but my dad does not like animals. He likes animals and all it is just that does not like caring for them. That does not mean he does not care about animals it means that he does not like to: Take them to the docter, feed them, take them on walks and care about there waste.

<h2>Why we have clent</h2>
<p>I was in a book club and the book was about dragons and <span style="color: gray; font-family: fantasy;">fantasy</span> and at the end of the book we had a meet up, and face timed the author (which was really cool). At the end we got a gold fish in a bag. We named him Dragon-Pearl (Pearl for short). after book club we went to the park and I put my fish under the puvillion and played. I came back when we were going to leave and he was upsidedown and that was the end of pearl. On the way home we bought a fish and everything above (in basic info) and named him Clent.</p>
