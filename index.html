Today I finished the book "The Cricket in Times Square" By George Selden. This book is great! I'm gonna get the next one! It's about a kid who finds a cricket in times square and gets a home for it, why the cricket makes friends in the subway station near the newspaper stand the kid and his parents own. Later they find his beautiful chirping talent! This book was so fun to read! I give it 5 STARS!</p>

Right now I am going to review a book named "Tom Swift and his Motor-Cycle" by Victor Appleton. It is an AWESOME book about a kid named Tom who buys a motorcycle from a man who hurt himself on it, meanwhile his dad is building a turbine motor that gets stolen by 3 criminals. Tom try's to get the model and the plans back and has fun and adventures along the way! AWESOME BOOK in fact I am going to start reading the next book in its series "Tom Swift and his Motor-Boat" Very soon. I give this 5 STARS</p>
